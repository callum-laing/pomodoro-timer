Pomodoro Timer built using Vue3 JS (Composition API)

This is a new version of my original repo: https://github.com/callum-laing/pomodoro-clock

Let's just say I failed at trying to host the original project on github pages using an outdated (that I assumed was still accurate) gh-pages branching attempt. Lesson learned... if hosting on github, just use Github Actions.

This updated project is hosted on cloudflare :)
